# 🎲 QuantQuest  
**Chess.com for Quant Trading**  
*Gamified Quantitative Finance Education & Simulation*  

---

## 🌍 Mission  
To democratize quantitative finance education by making it engaging, hands-on, and accessible—so that anyone can develop real trading intuition, not just speculative habits.  

---

## ⚠️ The Problem  
- **95% of trading education is noise**: influencer-driven, anecdotal, or flat-out unprofitable.  
- **Current simulators are shallow**: focus on guessing stock prices instead of building real quantitative skills.  
- **Learners burn out**: without clear progression, most quit within months.  
- **Quant education gap**: academic programs are too theoretical, while online content lacks rigor and structure.

- 🐉 **Boss Battles vs. Market Crashes**: Survive 1987, 2000, 2008, 2020 with strategy resilience.  
- 🏆 **Achievements & Unlockables**: Tools like Monte Carlo simulators, options pricing engines, factor models unlocked through mastery.  
- 📊 **Leaderboards**:  
  - Global, regional, and skill-specific rankings.  
  - Categories: “Sharpe Masters,” “Crash Survivors,” “Puzzle Speedruns,” and more.  
  - Weekly/monthly resets to keep competition fresh.  
  - Teams & schools can compete, fostering community and group learning.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

### 🔙 Backend (Node.js Ecosystem)  
- **Framework**: Express.js  
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO (real-time leaderboards, live challenges, multiplayer elements).  
- **Data & APIs**:  
  - PostgreSQL (relational DB, strong for financial data + user progress tracking).  
  - Redis (caching leaderboards, session storage, real-time event queues).  
  - Prisma ORM (developer-friendly, TypeScript-native ORM for PostgreSQL).  
- **Quant / Data Processing**:  
  - Python microservices (FastAPI/Flask) for quant libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).  
  - Communicate with Node.js via gRPC or REST.  
  - Containerization with Docker for scaling simulations.  
- **Auth & Security**:  
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with refresh tokens.  
  - OAuth2 / SSO support (for institutions, schools).  

### 🎨 Frontend (Gamified & Interactive)  
- **Framework**: Next.js (React) – SEO-friendly, SSR + CSR hybrid.  
- **UI Libraries**: TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion (animations).  
- **Charts & Visualization**: Recharts, D3.js, Plotly.js.  
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit.  
- **Data Fetching**: React Query / TanStack Query.  

### ☁️ Infrastructure & DevOps  
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes (for scaling backtests & simulations).  
- **Cloud**: AWS or GCP  
  - EC2/EKS for compute  
  - S3/Cloud Storage for historical market datasets  
  - RDS/CloudSQL for PostgreSQL  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (backend), Sentry (frontend errors).  

---

## 📌 Extra Considerations  
- **Leaderboard scaling**: Use Redis sorted sets for real-time leaderboard updates.  
- **PvP Challenges**: WebSockets for low-latency head-to-head games.  
- **Market Data**: Integrate APIs (Polygon.io, Alpha Vantage, Tiingo) for realistic datasets.  
- **Future Institutional Needs**: Keep Python microservices modular so advanced quant toolkits can plug in easily.
